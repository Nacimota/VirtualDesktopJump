# VirtualDesktopJump
A simple .NET app that provides buttons (icons) in the notification area for switching virtual desktops in Windows.

Said buttons simply trigger the `Ctrl`+`Win`+`←` and `Ctrl`+`Win`+`→` keyboard shortcuts which move to the previous and next virtual desktops, respectively. Keyboard shortcuts are fine, but sometimes I just want to click a button.

You may need to drag the icons out of the overflow panel and position them as you desire. To exit, right-click on either icon and select `Exit`.
